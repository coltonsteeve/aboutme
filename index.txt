44563-01 Colton Steeve Introduction

Colton Steeve

I am a senior working on a BS in Interactive Digital Media: Computer Science. I should be able to graduate this fall and I'm excited to get out into the world.

I am from a small town called Hopkins, Missouri and I went to school at North Nodaway RVI. I enjoy playing music and video games. I also like to distro hop between different Linux distributions to try out all of the different features and desktop environments. 

When I graduate, I hope to do some kind of web development or design. I enjoy making websites and just coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in general. I feel like there is so much that can be done with those languages. If you use Electron, you can even use those languages to make desktop programs.

One interesting fact about me is that I studied abroad in Tokyo in the summer of 2017.
